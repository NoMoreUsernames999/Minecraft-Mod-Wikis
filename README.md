# Minecraft Mod Wikis

**A collection of wikis and guides for various mods in Minecraft 1.12**

Welcome to the Cyclone Modding Wiki Extension Project, AKA the Cyclone-WEP. This repository contains links to various guides and wikis created by me or forked from wikis created by the devs themselves. There are many mods which lack documentation or who's existing documentation was sparse and/ or difficult to understand, so I took it upon myself to improve them.\
To view a wiki, select one of the links below:

* [Recurrent Complex](https://github.com/NoMoreUsernames999/Recurrent-Complex-Wiki/).
* Just Enough Dimensions (WIP).
* Dimensional Control (WIP).
* Cave Generator (WIP).
